# ProTable Advanced Scaffold

## Scenario

This example demonstrates production-style ProTable usage: query, batch actions, export, and status switch.

- Route: `/examples/pro-table-advanced`
- View: `src/views/examples/scaffold/pro-table-advanced/index.vue`

## Core Capabilities

- Column config and value-type rendering
- Query form + pagination flow
- Batch selection, disable, and delete
- Toolbar export and column settings

## Reuse Notes

1. Extract column definitions into reusable modules.
2. Standardize confirm/toast flow for batch actions.
3. Keep export filters aligned with current query state.
